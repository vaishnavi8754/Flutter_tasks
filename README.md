 #📱 Flutter UI Tasks

This repository contains beginner-friendly Flutter application tasks implemented as part of practice exercises. The tasks are saved as Word documents for easy reference, but the included code can be directly run in DartPad or any Flutter environment.

🚀 Tasks Overview
Task 1: Sign In / Sign Up Page

A responsive page with two tabs:

Sign In → Accepts Email/User ID and Password.

Sign Up → Allows new users to register with basic details.

Clean UI with proper alignment and input fields.

Demonstrates usage of TabBar, TextField, and ElevatedButton.

Focus: Switching between Sign In and Sign Up within the same page.

Task 2: User Registration Page

A simple and neat Registration Form with:

Full Name

Email Address

Password (hidden while typing)

Includes a Register button:

If any field is empty → Shows a SnackBar with: "Please fill in all fields."

If all fields are filled → Shows a SnackBar with: "Welcome, <Name>! Registration Successful."

Demonstrates form validation and user feedback in Flutter.
